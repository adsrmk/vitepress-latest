# Enterprise plan

All customers on enterprise plan can have **multiple servers under their clusters.**
All these servers will be managed by us so agencies and freelancers can focus on their clients demands.

What can you expect?

- Fully managed server(s) cluster; we make sure all servers are functional, up-to-date and reach a SLA uptime of atleast 99.5%
- Automated server back-ups; in case of a force-majeure event or unexpected failure, we create automatic server back-ups on weekly basis. They can fully restore a server's disk if unfortunate events may occur


## Scaling possibilities  
We provide the flexibility to scale your server whenever you are responding to high-demand traffic spikes, 
outgrowing your current allocation, or simply prefer the simplicity of maintaining your entire stack on a single webserver.

**Benefits:**
- Everything central on one server; requires less-monitoring which server is using more or less.
- If one of your customer's is experiencing lack of performance or outgrowing server memory. Scaling up is a fast-resolution.

## Clustered enviroment
In contrary to scaling up - If you like to organize your business or simply seperate several clients from others, We can create a multiple-server cluster enviroment.
This gives you the option to place website(s) under specific servers and vice versa.
