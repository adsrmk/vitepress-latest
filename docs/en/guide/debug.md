# Debug

The Debug section provides specialized tools to identify and resolve site errors by controlling WordPress’s built-in troubleshooting modes.

### Troubleshooting Tools

- **WP_DEBUG_LOG:** Save all errors to a specific log file located at wp-content/debug.log for later review or off-screen notice tracking.
- **WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY:** Enable this to show debug messages directly within the page's HTML.
