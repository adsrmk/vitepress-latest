# 400 Bad Request

A 400 Bad Request error occurs when the server cannot process a request because it is invalid. This can result in certain pages being inaccessible through the back-end, and it may prevent plugins or other files from being uploaded. It usually happens when ModSecurity is enabled, as it can block legitimate requests and trigger errors.

::: tip How to resolve
If you are still developing your website, it is recommended to *temporarily disable ModSecurity*. To do this; Go to your website in the hosting control panel, click Advanced, select Security, and toggle ModSecurity off.
