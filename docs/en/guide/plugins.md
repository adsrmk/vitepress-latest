# Plugins

The Plugins tab allows you to oversee all the functional extensions installed on your WordPress site. 
From this central dashboard, you can perform updates and manage activation states without needing to log directly into your WordPress admin area. 
This is useful when plugins are incompatible or cause crashes and stability issues.


### Plugin Status

Each plugin displays a clear status badge to help you identify its current state.
- **Active:** The plugin is currently running and providing functionality to your site.
- **Inactive:** The plugin is installed on your website but is not currently in use.

### Available Actions
   
- **Activate/Deactivate:** Toggle the plugin's functionality on/off.
- **Delete:** Remove the plugin files permanently from your site.
- **Enable auto-updates:** Set specific plugins to update automatically whenever a new version is released by the developer. If a plugin is out of date, a dedicated notification box will appear detailing that a new version is available.
