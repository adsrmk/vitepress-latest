# Redirect
description: Managing website redirections  


A **redirect** is a method used to automatically send visitors from one web address to another.  
Redirects are often implemented when a page has been moved, renamed, or replaced — ensuring users always reach the correct content.


## 301 and 302 Redirects

1. **301 Redirect** – A **permanent redirect** indicating that a web page has been permanently moved to a new URL.  
   This type helps maintain search engine rankings by transferring the SEO value from the old URL to the new one.
2. **302 Redirect** – A **temporary redirect** used when a web page has been moved to a new URL temporarily.  
   It signals to search engines that the move is not permanent, keeping the SEO value tied to the original URL.


## Creating a Redirect

1. In the website dashboard, navigate to **Advanced** and select **Redirects**.  
2. Click **Add Redirect**.  
3. Choose the redirect type — either **301** or **302**.  
4. Enter the source domain and the destination URL.  
5. Click **Add**
