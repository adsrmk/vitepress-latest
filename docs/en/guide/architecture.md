# EVCloud Infrastructure

At the core of our service is a commitment to transparency. We believe that if you’re trusting us with your mission-critical applications, you deserve to know exactly what is "under the hood."
We don’t use generic or outdated "white-box" servers. Below is the breakdown of the hardware and the availability architecture that powers your business.

### Architecture
All servers utilize a x86-64 architecture running on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
