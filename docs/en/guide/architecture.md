# EVCloud Infrastructure

At the core of our service is a commitment to transparency. We believe that if you’re trusting us with your mission-critical applications, you deserve to know exactly what is "under the hood."
We don’t use generic or outdated "white-box" servers. Below is the breakdown of the hardware and the availability architecture that powers your business.

Servers are divided by multiple providers. We are always eager to use the latest available technology when it comes to security and performance.
