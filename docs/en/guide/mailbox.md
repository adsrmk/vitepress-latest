# Mailbox

An email mailbox allows you to send, receive, and manage email messages associated with your domain.

1. Go to the [Emails↗](https://cloud.envision.nl/emails) section in the sidebar.
2. Click Add Account in the top-right corner.
3. Choose your email address and domain.
4. Select an account type.
5. Set the mailbox size (maximum 1 GB).
6. Create a username and password for the mailbox.

::: tip Note
In most cases, a 1GB mailbox provides sufficient storage for thousands of emails without attachments. The Essential Plan includes 3 email accounts, with additional accounts available on higher plans. If your business frequently sends and receives large files, we recommend upgrading to Google Workspace or ProtonMail for increased storage and more advanced functionalities.
