::: tip Note

In most cases, a 1GB mailbox provides sufficient storage for thousands of emails without attachments. The Essential Plan includes 3 email accounts, with additional accounts available on higher plans. If your business frequently sends and receives large files, we recommend upgrading to Google Workspace or ProtonMail for increased storage and more advanced functionalities.
