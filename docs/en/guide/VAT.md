# VAT 
In compliance with regional tax regulations, we apply Value Added Tax (VAT) to customers—both individuals and businesses—located in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK).

**What is VAT?** 
VAT is a consumption tax applied to most goods and services within the EU and UK. This includes digital services such as hosting.
The tax is calculated as a percentage added to your total invoice amount. Because VAT rates are determined by individual countries, the applicable rate will vary based on your primary residence or the country where your business is legally registered.
 
Please be aware that this information is not professional tax advice. For all other tax-related questions, please contact your legal advisor or local tax office.


## VAT Rates

While countries may have multiple tax tiers, our services are categorized under the standard VAT rate.
Tax rates are subject to change by local governments. For the most up-to-date information regarding your specific region, please consult the official government resources below:

- **EU Member States:** [Official EU VAT Rates](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/taxation/vat/vat-rules-rates/index_en.htm#inline-nav-6)
- **United Kingdom:** [Official UK VAT Rates](https://www.gov.uk/vat-rates)

Note: If you are located in the EU or UK, we are generally required by law to collect VAT on all your purchases unless a **valid exemption** or "Reverse Charge" applies.

## Tax exemption

Depending on your organization’s legal status or geographic location, you may qualify for a tax exemption. Tax exemptions are typically granted to several types of entities, including Non-Profit Organizations such as charitable groups and NGOs with valid 501(c)(3) or equivalent status; Educational Institutions including accredited schools, universities, and research centers; Government Agencies at the federal, state, or local level; and Resellers who are purchasing services specifically for resale to third parties.

In certain countries, small business schemes may allow for tax exemptions based on revenue. For example, in the Netherlands, the Small Business Scheme (KOR) may apply if your business is located in the Netherlands and your annual turnover is less than €20,000.

To apply a tax-exempt status to your account, please follow our verification process:

1. Gather Documentation: Prepare a digital copy of your official State-issued Exemption Certificate or government approval letter (e.g., KOR confirmation).
2. Contact Support: Reach out to our support team at support@envision.nl
3. Verification: Our team will review your documents within 1–2 business days. Once approved, tax will be removed from all future invoices.
