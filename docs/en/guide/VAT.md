# VAT 

In compliance with regional tax regulations, we apply Value Added Tax (VAT) to customers—both individuals and businesses—located in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK).

**What is VAT?**
VAT is a consumption tax applied to most goods and services within the EU and UK. This includes digital services such as hosting.
The tax is calculated as a percentage added to your total invoice amount. Because VAT rates are determined by individual countries, the applicable rate will vary based on your primary residence or the country where your business is legally registered.
 
Please be aware that this information is not professional tax advice. If you need to update your tax ID or exemption status in our system, you can do so in the billing portal. 
For all other tax-related questions, please contact your legal advisor or local tax office.


## VAT Rates

While countries may have multiple tax tiers, our services are categorized under the standard VAT rate.
Tax rates are subject to change by local governments. For the most up-to-date information regarding your specific region, please consult the official government resources below:

Note: If you are located in the EU or UK, we are generally required by law to collect VAT on all your purchases unless a **valid exemption** or "Reverse Charge" applies.
