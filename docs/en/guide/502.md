# 502 Bad Gateway

A Bad Gateway error happens when the PHP-FPM container fails to provide a valid response to the upstream server.
While server-side resource issues are common, 502s can also happen due to front-end or development changes.

**Common causes**

- Code or script issues – inefficient scripts, heavy database queries, or new themes/plugins that generate long-running requests can block the backend and exceed configured timeouts.
- Resource limitations – insufficient CPU, RAM, or disk I/O on the backend server, often occurring as websites grow and existing hosting plans become insufficient.
- Poor configuration - incorrect or untested adjustments in configuration files (such as .htaccess, Nginx server blocks, PHP-FPM pool settings, or php.ini) can break communication between Nginx and PHP-FPM 
 


## Troubleshooting

To re-enable connection with the PHP container, you need to restart it.

1. Access the cloud panel and head to your [Website↗](https://cloud.envision.nl/websites)
2. In the horizontal menu bar at the top, click **Advanced** and select **Developer tools**
3. In the first section and third row under `Restart PHP container` press **Restart**.

::: Note
Restarting the PHP container may provide a temporary fix, 
but it is strongly recommended to identify and resolve the root cause, as 502 errors should not occur under normal operations.
