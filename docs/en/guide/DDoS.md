# DDoS Protection

In a DDoS (**distributed denial-of-service**) attack, an attacker sends thousands of fake requests in an attempt to exceed the bandwidth, 
flood a server's resources, and overload the system. By doing this, valid requests can only be processed very slowly or not at all. 
A massive amount of compromised computers (botnets) are often used to create a gigantic amount of data traffic.

Our system protects you and your data by utilizing Arbor and Juniper hardware.

Our approach to DDoS protection begins with automated recognition of attack patterns. Rather than merely monitoring traffic volumes or packet counts, 
our systems analyze the incoming traffic to accurately identify the type of attack and respond with precision.

Once an attack is recognized, we move to the next stage: filtering traffic for known attack patterns. 
Here, we channel malicious traffic through scrubbing filters designed to neutralize the most common threats, 
including DNS reflection, NTP reflection, and UDP floods, ensuring that only legitimate traffic reaches your servers.

Finally, in the layer of challenge response automation and dynamic filtering, we tackle more sophisticated attacks, such as SYN floods, DNS floods, and invalid packets. 
Our system adapts in real time to emerging and unique threats, reliably mitigating them while maintaining smooth operation for legitimate users.
