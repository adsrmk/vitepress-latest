# DDoS Protection

In a DDoS (**distributed denial-of-service**) attack, an attacker sends thousands of fake requests in an attempt to exceed the bandwidth, 
flood a server's resources, and overload the system. By doing this, valid requests can only be processed very slowly or not at all. 
A massive amount of compromised computers (botnets) are often used to create a gigantic amount of data traffic.

With **Hetzner GmbH** as our load balancer and collocation partner, our systems and your data is protected by utilizing Arbor and Juniper hardware.

### Recognition of attack pattern
Their approach to DDoS protection begins with automated recognition of attack patterns. Rather than merely monitoring traffic volumes or packet counts, 
the system analyzes the incoming traffic to accurately identify the type of attack and respond with precision.

### Filtering traffic 
Once an attack is recognized, it moves to the next stage: filtering traffic for known attack patterns. 
Here, we channel malicious traffic through scrubbing filters designed to neutralize the most common threats, 
including DNS reflection, NTP reflection, and UDP floods, ensuring that only legitimate traffic reaches your servers.

### Challenge-response authentication 
Finally, in the layer of challenge response automation and dynamic filtering, we tackle more sophisticated attacks, such as SYN floods, DNS floods, and invalid packets. 
The system adapts in real time to emerging and unique threats, reliably mitigating them while maintaining smooth operation for legitimate users.
