description: Allow team members to collaborate on a project.


It is possible to invite additional developers, designers, or users to collaborate on a project within the platform. 
Collaboration features are designed to make teamwork more easy — whether you are working with an in-house team, an external agency, or independent freelancers. 
Invited members can be assigned specific roles and permissions to ensure that access remains secure and well-organized. 
The account owner always retains full administrative control over the account and its resources and cannot be removed under any circumstances.



## Roles and Permissions

New users can be invited through a direct link or an email invitation. 
During the invitation process, the account owner can assign one of two available roles, each with its own level of access and permissions.

1. **Super Administrator** – Grants full access to all resources within the account, including emails, integrations, logs, and all associated websites.
2. **Collaborator** – Provides restricted access to specific websites. Collaborators can manage files, databases, security settings, and other related functions, but their permissions are limited to the assigned website(s).
This role is ideal for teams managing multiple projects under a single account.
