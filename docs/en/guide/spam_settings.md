# Spam Settings

The Spam section provides essential controls to filter unwanted emails and protect your inbox from malicious content. Use these tools to balance security and ensure that legitimate messages reach you without delay.

### Adjusting Sensitivity

The system uses a point-based scoring system (typically 1–10) to determine what constitutes spam.

- **Stricter** (Lower Score): Catch more spam, but increases the risk of flagging legitimate emails.
- **Lenient** (Higher Score): Reduces the chance of missing real emails, but allows more unwanted clutter through.

## Allow/block list

- **Whitelist:** Ensure specific, trusted senders or domains are never blocked by the filter.
- **Blacklist:** Block specific email addresses or entire domains permanently.
