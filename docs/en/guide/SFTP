# Unable to access FTP

Under normal circumstances, users can navigate to **Advanced** â†’ FTP to create an account and access their website files via the FTP protocol. 
However, for security reasons, our servers do not support password-based authentication. 
Instead, you must create an SSH key and upload it in the panel to enable secure access to your website files. 

::: tip
Don't forget to create an FTP account, you still need it to login using the name.
