# setup SMTP


To use SMTP for sending emails on your WordPress website, you'll need a plugin. We recommend the Easy WP SMTP plugin, as it's easy to set up and work with.
Begin by installing the Easy WP SMTP plugin on your WordPress site. Once installed and activated, you'll be guided through an easy onboarding process.


1. Choose Your SMTP Mailer
Select Other SMTP in the bottom-right corner.
We use Mailgun's SMTP relay services. If this setup doesn’t work, contact us for a sending API key, and we’ll configure it for you.



2. Configure Values
Input the values from the Email Client Settings available in your EVC panel.

| Variable        |      Value      |
| ------------- | :-----------: |
| SMTP host    | mail.yourdomain.com |
| Encryption   |   TLS (Port 587)   |  
| SMTP Auth |   Enabled    |  
| SMTP Username |  Your email address   |  
| SMTP Password |  Your password   |  


In the final two input fields (name and email), specify how you'd like your customers to receive and interact with the emails you send.




3. Finish setup and send test mail

If you want additional features like weekly reports, detailed logs, or alerts (pro version), you can select so. 
If not, simply click next or skip. To confirm everything is working, send a test email once you've completed the setup.
