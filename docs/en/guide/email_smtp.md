# Setup SMTP email


To use SMTP for sending emails on your WordPress website, you'll need a plugin. We recommend the Easy WP SMTP plugin, as it's easy to set up and work with.

1. Choose Your SMTP Mailer
Once installed, select Other SMTP in the bottom-right corner.


2. Configure Values
Input the values from the Email Client Settings available in your EVC panel.

| Variable        |      Value      |
| ------------- | :-----------: |
| SMTP host    | mail.'yourdomain'.com |
| Encryption   |   TLS (Port 587)   |  
| SMTP Auth |   Enabled    |  
| SMTP Username |  Your email address   |  
| SMTP Password |  Your password   |  

<br>


In the final two input fields (name and email), specify how you'd like your customers to receive and interact with the emails you send.



3. Finish setup and send test mail
If you want additional features like weekly reports, detailed logs, or alerts (pro version), you can select so. 
If not, simply click next or skip. To confirm everything is working, send a test email once you've completed the setup.
