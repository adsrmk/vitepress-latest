# Catch All

A catch-all email address receives all emails sent to non-existent email addresses on your domain. This prevents messages from being rejected when an incorrect or unknown address is used.
For example, emails sent to info@, sales@, or random@yourdomain.com will all be delivered to the catch-all mailbox if those addresses do not exist.

### Functionalities
- Ensure no emails are missed due to typos
- Capture messages sent to unknown or temporary addresses
- Centralize incoming mail for a domain
