# Failed payment(s)

In the event that an initial transaction cannot be completed—often due to routine card expirations or bank communication errors—our system begins a grace period designed to give your team time to resolve the issue without loss of service.

<br>

**Second Notification (Day 3):** 
If the initial payment is unsuccessful, a second attempt will be made three days later. If this is resolved, no further action is required. If it remains outstanding, an automated reminder will be sent to the administrative contact.

**Service Interruption (Day 8):** 
On the eighth day, a third attempt is made. Should the payment remain outstanding at this stage, the account will move into a Suspended State. To protect your resources, all active applications and databases will be taken offline until the account balance is settled.

**Final Resolution Attempt (Day 14):** 
Fourteen days following the initial due date, a final attempt will be made to process the outstanding balance using any payment methods associated with the account. This is a final measure to help maintain your account and prevent permanent data removal. If an invoice remains unpaid for 15 days, the associated plans and services will be formally decommissioned.

Notice of permanent Deletion: Upon cancellation, all data hosted on our infrastructure—including production environments, staging instances, and associated databases—will be permanently purged from our active servers. In accordance with our security and data retention protocols, this action is irreversible. We strongly advise maintaining external backups to mitigate the risk of total data loss during a billing lapse.
