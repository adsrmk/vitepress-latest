# Failed payment

Stripe's billing system automatically charges your default card or SEPA direct debit on the 1st day of each month.
Payments may fail due to insufficient funds, or if a card is reported lost or expired. 

## Second attempt

Three days after the initial failed attempt, the system will automatically try to process the payment again. If this second attempt is successful, no further action is required. 
However, if the payment fails for a second time, you will receive another email notifying you of the outstanding invoice that requires your attention.

## Third attempt 

**8 days** after the initial failed attempt, our billing system will automatically try to process the payment again. 
if the payment fails for a third time, you will receive a third email notifying you of the outstanding invoice. 
At this stage, we will **suspend all plans and services**, which will stop all traffic and active processes. This means that customers are unable to view your site.

## Final attempt 

14 days after the initial failed attempt, our billing system will make a final automatic attempt to process the payment. 
If we are unable to charge your primary card, we may attempt to charge any other cards on file to bring your account up to date.
However, if this fourth attempt fails, our system will cancel your plans and services. Any invoice that remains unpaid for 15 days results in immediate cancellation. 
Upon cancellation, **all data hosted on our platform will be deleted.** 
Following this fourth failure and subsequent cancellation, all sites (including live and staging environments), applications, and databases associated with the plan will be **permanently removed**.
