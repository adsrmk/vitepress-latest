# Add Domain or website

Adding a domain is straightforward and takes less than a minute. Make sure your [DNS configuration](#) is set up to map your website(s) to the correct server(s).

1. In the panel, go to **Websites**
2. In the top-right corner, select **Add new website**
3. Choose **blank, app or clone website.**
- **Blank** → Creates a domain and webspace under public_html with no files. (most used in plain HTML/CSS/JS websites)
- **App** → Installs Wordpress with configured values for the admin account. *At the moment we only support WP. But more apps like magento, lavarel and prestashop will be added in the future*
- **Clone website (business plan only)** → Clones a existing website with a new database. Make sure **"Perform a WordPress search and replace"** is *enabled*
4. Fill in your domain and follow the configured steps to complete the process

(5). *For business customers or agencies using managed cloud services:* you can choose where to deploy a website on a specific server.
This allows you to balance load and prevent high resource usage on a single server, ensuring stability.
