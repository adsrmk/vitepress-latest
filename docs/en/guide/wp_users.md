# Wordpress Users

The Users section provides a centralized hub to manage administrative and team access for your WordPress application. 

<div class="tip custom-block" style="padding-top: 8px">
WordPress users are different from collaborative users. They can only access your WordPress site through the back-end and do not have access to the cloud panel.

### Manage Accounts

- **Add New Users:** Use the Add user button to grant site access to new team members. It requires a username, email-adress and password for authentication.
- **Edit Details:** To modify existing user information, such as usernames or associated email addresses, open the vertical dot menu on the right side of the user and select **Edit**

- **Delete Access:** Remove users permanently to revoke their entry to the production environment. *This action is irreversible. Always double-check and create a backup before proceeding, especially if content was created under the primary or admin account.*
