# Webmail

When creating your email account, you can access your mailbox using Roundcube webmail. This allows you to log in from anywhere with an internet connection.
Webmail is available on your (sub)domain, for example: https://mail.yourdomain.nl, and can also be accessed directly from the cloud panel.

Avoid logging in from unknown or unsecure locations, such as public internet cafés or unfamiliar devices. For better security and ease of use, we recommend connecting your email account to a trusted mail application like Outlook or Gmail on your device(s).
