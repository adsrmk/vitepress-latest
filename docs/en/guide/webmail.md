# Webmail

When creating your email account, you can access your mailbox using Roundcube webmail. This allows you to log in from anywhere with an internet connection.
Webmail is available on your (sub)domain, for example: https://mail.yourdomain.nl, and can also be accessed directly from the cloud panel.

We do not recommend logging in from unknown or unsecured locations, such as public internet cafés or unfamiliar devices, as this may pose security risks.
As a final recommendation, we advise linking your email account to a trusted mail application such as Outlook or Gmail on your device(s). This improves security and ease of use.
