# Payment methods

To facilitate secure payment processing, you are required to enter your billing details within your dashboard. 
For your security, your sensitive payment information is never stored on our servers. All data is handled exclusively by **Stripe**, our primary payment processor. 
Stripe is globally recognized as one of the most secure providers in the industry, maintaining strict PCI-compliance to ensure your financial data remains encrypted and protected at all times.



Available methods
- iDEAL
- Credit/Debit card
- SPEA Direct debit.


### Automatic billing charges
We accept Credit Cards and SEPA Direct Debit for automated subscription renewals. 
Once a payment method is established, corresponding fees will be deducted automatically on each billing date to ensure continuous service coverage. 
This is mostly for monthly and anual subscription plans.


### Pay invoices
To pay invoices we support Credit, SEPA and iDEAL. Invoices can be found within the stripe's customer portal.
