# Payment methods

To facilitate secure payment processing, you are required to enter your billing details within your dashboard. 
For your security, your sensitive payment information is never stored on our servers. All data is handled exclusively by **Stripe**, our primary payment processor. 
Stripe is globally recognized as one of the most secure providers in the industry, maintaining strict PCI-compliance to ensure your financial data remains encrypted and protected at all times.


We support **Debit/Credit Cards** and **SEPA Direct Debit** for all automated subscription renewals; additionally, **iDEAL** is available for the settlement of individual invoices. All outstanding balances and pending payments can be managed directly through your secure Stripe Billing Portal.

Once a primary payment method is established, applicable fees will be deducted automatically on each billing date to ensure uninterrupted service continuity. This automated billing cycle applies to both monthly and annual subscription plans. **All recurring charges are processed on the first day of each month.**
