# Payment methods

To facilitate secure transactions, we require you to manage your billing details directly through your dashboard. For your protection, sensitive payment information is never stored on our servers. All data is handled exclusively by Stripe, our primary payment processor. As an industry leader, Stripe maintains rigorous PCI-compliance to ensure your financial data remains encrypted and protected at all times.

We support Debit/Credit Cards and SEPA Direct Debit for all automated subscription renewals, while iDEAL is available for the settlement of individual invoices. You can view your payment history, manage outstanding balances, and update your preferences at any time via your secure Stripe Billing Portal.

Once a primary payment method is established, applicable fees are deducted automatically to ensure uninterrupted service continuity. This automated cycle applies to both monthly and annual subscription plans, with all recurring charges processed on the first day of each month.
