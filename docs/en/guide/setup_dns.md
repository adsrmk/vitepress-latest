# Setup DNS records

Every domain name relies on DNS (Domain Name System) to connect visitors to the right server. 
Understanding nameservers and DNS records helps you manage your website, email, and other services efficiently.

When connecting your domain you have **2 options.**

1. **Change Nameservers Completely**. If you want everything (website, mail, subdomains) to work automatically with our systems.
EV Cloud will handle all DNS records for you — fully managed and ready to go. 
2. **Manage DNS Separately**. Ideal if you want more control: for example, you use email services from another provider (like Google Workspace, Microsoft 365) or DNS providers like Cloudflare;
   but still want to host your website with EV Cloud.


## Option 1



1. Login and search for the DNS settings at your registrar.
2. Find nameservers and update them to the following:
   
 ```
ns1.envision.nl
ns2.envision.nl
```

::: tip info
​Typically, there are four input fields for nameserver information, but you only need to fill in two of them. This is sufficient for proper configuration.
