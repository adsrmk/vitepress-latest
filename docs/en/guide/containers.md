# Containerization

A website container is a **self-contained environment** that hosts your website and all its associated resources. 
Think of it as a **“sandbox”** where your website runs independently from other sites on the server. 
Each container has its own *allocated storage, processes, and settings*, ensuring that your site operates securely and efficiently without affecting others.

Containers isolate resources such as:

- CPU and memory usage
- File storage
- Web server processes
- PHP and database instances

This isolation improves performance, security, and stability across all hosted websites.
