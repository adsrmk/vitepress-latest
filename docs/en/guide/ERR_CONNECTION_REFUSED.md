# ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

This error is relatively uncommon and occurs when the server refuses the connection, often due to security settings or if it doesn't exist.
It can also be caused by your VPN, proxy, or local firewall blocking the website or port.

**Try temporarily disabling your antivirus, VPN, or proxy** to see if the issue persists.

::: tip
If the issue persists despite all DNS settings being correctly configured, please contact our support team.
