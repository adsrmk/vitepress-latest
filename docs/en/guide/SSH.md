# Connect to your workspace with SSH keys

In this guide, we will use the [Termius application ↗](https://termius.com/index.html)￼ to generate an SSH key for secure server access. Termius is a widely-used SSH client that enables secure connections to remote servers via SSH keys or FTP. Its intuitive interface simplifies the management and organization of multiple server connections.

1. Navigate to the Vault tab in Termius.
2. Select Keychains.
3. Click on Keys, and a dropdown menu will appear. From here, choose **"Generate Key".**

5. You can add a passphrase for extra security. This way, if someone gets access to your device, they will need to enter the passphrase to connect.
6. When done, click Generate & save
7. In the next window, you will see both a private and public key. Copy the public key and paste it into the EVC panel.
