# Setting up Email Forwarding

Email forwarding automatically redirects incoming emails from one email address to another. 
This helps manage multiple accounts or ensures you don’t miss important messages.


1. Navigate to the [Emails↗](https://cloud.envision.nl/emails) section.
2. Select the desired mailbox.
3. Scroll down to the Forwarders section.
4. Enter the email address where you wish to forward incoming messages.
