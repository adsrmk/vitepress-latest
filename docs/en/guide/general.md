# General 

The General tab is the primary dashboard for your WordPress application. 
It provides a overview of your site’s configuration, including your **live URL, file structure, and core software updates.**
<br>

### Site Details & File Path
- **Site URL:** This is the primary address used by WordPress to generate internal links and redirects. If you have recently changed your domain, ensure this matches your live environment.
- **File Path:** This shows the root directory of your WordPress installation (usually public_html). You’ll need this path if you are configuring SFTP or managing files via the command line.

### WordPress Version
Keeping your site secure means keeping your software up to date. This section allows you to manage how your wordpress site handles core updates.
- **Update Preferences:** You can toggle between automatic updates for minor versions (security patches and bug fixes) or major releases. A quick glance at the green badge will tell you if your site is currently running the latest stable version of WordPress. *We recommend updating only to minor versions to avoid compatibility issues with plugins and themes.*

### Maintenance mode
If you are performing design overhauls or critical updates, you can toggle Maintenance Mode on. A message lets visitors know the site is temporarily unavailable.
