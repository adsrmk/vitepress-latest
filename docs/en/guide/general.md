# General 

The General tab is the primary dashboard for your WordPress application. 
It provides a overview of your site’s configuration, including your **live URL, file structure, and core software updates.**

1. Site Details & File Path
2. 
You can verify where your site is live and where its files live on the server.

- **Site URL:** This is the primary address used by WordPress to generate internal links and redirects. If you have recently changed your domain, ensure this matches your live environment.
- **File Path:** This shows the root directory of your WordPress installation (usually public_html). You’ll need this path if you are configuring SFTP or managing files via the command line.
