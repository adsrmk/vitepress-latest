# DNSSEC


DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) is a set of extensions to DNS that adds a layer of security. 
It helps protect against attacks such as cache poisoning by ensuring that the responses to DNS queries are authentic and have not been tampered with. 
DNSSEC does this by using digital signatures, allowing DNS resolvers to verify that the data received is legitimate and comes from the correct source.
