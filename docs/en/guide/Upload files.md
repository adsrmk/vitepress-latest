# Manage and upload files

When users add a new website, they can navigate to the **File Manager** to manage all their web files.
It has tools that lets you compress, download, edit and unpack all files with ease.

 
### public_html
The www entry is simply a shortcut to **public_html/**, so you can treat them interchangeably if desired.
This is also the location where wordpress installs its core files such as wp-admin, wp-content and wp-includes.


### Sub-domains
A subdomain can be found within the primary domain under files and is listed in a seperate directory.
