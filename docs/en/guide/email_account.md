# Create an email account

An email account enables sending and receiving of messages. 
Creating or deleting accounts is quick and straightforward, typically taking only a minute to complete.


1. Go to the [Emailsâ†—](https://cloud.envision.nl/emails) section in the sidebar.
2. Click Add Account in the top-right corner.
3. Choose your email address and preferred domain name.
4. Select an Account Type
5. Set a mailbox size (max: 1GB)
6. Create a name and password for your mailbox


In most cases, a 1GB mailbox is more than enough to store thousands of emails without attachments. However, if your business relies on sending
and receiving a lot of files. We recommend switching to google workspace or proton mail.
