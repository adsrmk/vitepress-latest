# Create an email account

An email account enables sending and receiving of messages. 
Creating or deleting accounts is quick and straightforward, typically taking only a minute to complete.


1. Go to the [Emailsâ†—](https://cloud.envision.nl/emails) section in the sidebar.
2. Click Add Account in the top-right corner.
3. Choose your email address and preferred domain name.
4. Select an Account Type
5. Set a mailbox size (max: 1GB)
6. Create a name and password for your mailbox
   

In most cases, a 1GB mailbox provides ample storage for thousands of emails without attachments. The Essential Plan includes 3 email accounts, with additional accounts available on higher plans. If your business frequently sends and receives large files, we recommend upgrading to Google Workspace or ProtonMail for increased storage and advanced functionality
