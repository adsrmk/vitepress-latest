# Unable to access FTP

Under normal circumstances, users can navigate to **Advanced** → FTP to create an account and access their website files via the FTP protocol. 
However, for security reasons, our servers do not support password-based authentication. 
Instead, you must create an SSH key and upload it in the panel to enable secure access to your website files.

::: tip
Remember to create an FTP account — even when using SSH keys, the account itself is still required for authentication (username) when logging in.
