# Enterprise plan

The enterprise plan was created for agencies, freelancers or high-performing ecommerce sites. 
You can diverse, scale and move websites/servers for a complete control on how you want your agency to be run.
All these servers will be managed by us so agencies and freelancers can focus on their clients demands.

**What can you expect?**

- Fully managed server(s); we make sure all servers are functional, up-to-date and reach a SLA uptime of atleast 99.5%
- Automated server back-ups; in case of a force-majeure event or unexpected failure, we create automatic server back-ups on weekly basis. They can fully restore a server's disk if unfortunate events occur.

That said, we want to be clear that we do not manage customer websites, provide coding support, or assist with application design. While these services are available at discounted enterprise rates, they are not included in the infrastructure plan.



## Scaling possibilities  
We provide the flexibility to scale your server whenever you are responding to high-demand traffic spikes, 
outgrowing your current allocation, or simply prefer the simplicity of maintaining your entire stack on a single webserver.

**Benefits:**
- Everything central on one server; requires less-monitoring which server is using more or less.
- If one of your customer's is experiencing lack of performance or outgrowing server memory. Scaling up is a fast-resolution.

## Clustered enviroment
While scaling up makes a single server stronger, a multi-server clustering allows you to grow by spreading your work out. or need to keep certain clients completely separate from others.

**Benefits:**
- By spreading your sites across multiple servers, you create a more balanced workload that prevents any heavy single site from slowing down the rest.
- Makes your infrastructure more resilient; if one server experiences downtime, only the sites on that specific node are affected.
- More control on how you want websites to be diversified.
  

### Move a website
In a clustered environment, you have the option to migrate a website between servers. This mobility becomes essential when a site outgrows its current environment, requiring either total isolation to protect performance or a more powerful hardware profile to handle increased traffic and storage demands.
