# Enterprise plan

The Enterprise plan is designed for agencies, freelancers, and high-performance e-commerce businesses, handling all server management so you can focus on building and growing your business.

You can deploy, scale, and move websites or servers with control over how your infrastructure runs. All servers are fully managed by us, so agencies and freelancers can stay focused on delivering for their clients, not managing servers.

**What can you expect?**

- **Fully managed server(s);** we make sure all servers are functional, up-to-date and reach a SLA uptime of atleast 99.5%
- **Automated server back-ups;** in case of a force-majeure event or unexpected failure, we create automatic server back-ups on weekly basis. They can fully restore a server's disk if unfortunate events occur.
- **PHP.ini tuning;** Fine-tune PHP configuration to get the best performance out of your applications.
- **Priority support** Need to scale, make a specific backup or create a new server? Most requests are filled **within a hour**

## Expanding business
Envision allows you to scale your business as your customers grow, ensuring your infrastructure keeps pace with demand. This can be achieved in two ways: vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.


### Vertical scaling
Vertical scaling is the most straightforward approach, allowing you to increase the power of a single server by upgrading its resources—CPU, RAM, or storage—as your needs grow. This method is especially useful when a server is handling high-demand traffic spikes, outgrowing its current allocation, or if you prefer the simplicity of keeping your entire stack on a single webserver. With vertical scaling, you can quickly boost performance without the complexity of managing multiple servers, ensuring your applications continue running smoothly even under increased load.

**Benefits:**

- Everything centralized on one server, reducing the need to constantly monitor individual resource usage.
- Fast scaling when needed: if a customer experiences performance issues or outgrows server memory, resources can be upgraded quickly for immediate resolution.

## Horizontal scaling
While vertical scaling strengthens a single server, horizontal scaling lets you grow by spreading workloads across multiple servers. This approach is especially useful if you need to isolate certain clients, handle sustained high traffic, or increase redundancy.

**Benefits:**

- Distributes sites across multiple servers, creating a balanced workload and preventing any single heavy site from slowing down others.
- Improves resilience: if one server goes offline, only the sites on that node are affected, keeping the rest of your infrastructure running.
- Offers greater control over how websites are organized and diversified, giving you flexibility in managing client environments.

### Move a website
In a clustered environment, you have the option to migrate a website between servers. This mobility becomes essential when a site outgrows its current environment, requiring either total isolation to protect performance or a more powerful hardware profile to handle increased traffic and storage demands.
