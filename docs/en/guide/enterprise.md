# Enterprise plan

All customers on enterprise plan can have **multiple servers under their clusters.**
All these servers will be managed by us so agencies and freelancers can focus on their clients demands.

What can you expect?

- Fully managed server(s) cluster; we make sure all servers are functional, up-to-date and reach a SLA uptime of atleast 99.5%
- Automated server back-ups; in case of a force-majeure event or unexpected failure, we create automatic server back-ups on weekly basis. They can fully restore a server's disk if unfortunate events may occur


## Scaling possibilities  
We provide the flexibility to scale your server whenever you are responding to high-demand traffic spikes, 
outgrowing your current allocation, or simply prefer the simplicity of maintaining your entire stack on a single webserver.

The main perk of this approach is having everything in one central place, so you don't have to spend your time monitoring which server is doing what. Plus, if one of your customers starts lagging or runs out of memory, scaling up is a quick, one-click fix to get them back up to speed immediately.


## Clustered enviroment
While scaling up makes a single server stronger, our Multi-Server Clustering allows you to grow by spreading your work out. This is perfect if you want to keep your business organized or need to keep certain clients completely separate from others.

By creating a cluster, you gain the freedom to "drag and drop" websites onto specific servers. This means you can give a high-traffic client their own dedicated space or group smaller sites together, giving you total control over how your resources are used and how your clients are managed.



### Move a website
In a clustered environment, you have the option to migrate a website between servers. This mobility becomes essential when a site outgrows its current environment, requiring either total isolation to protect performance or a more powerful hardware profile to handle increased traffic and storage demands.
