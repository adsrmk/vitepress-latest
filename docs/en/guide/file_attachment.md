# Max. email file attachment size

We have a 75MB limit for email size, which includes both the message and any attachments.

Email was never intended or designed to be a large file transfer protocol. 
If you need to send or receive large files, we recommend using a file-sharing service such as WeTransferâ†— or cloud storage options like Dropbox or OneDrive.
