# Out of Office

The Out of office section allows you to set up automated email responses for when you are away or unavailable. 
Use this to provide automatic replies to your senders.

### Configure Your Auto-Response

- **Set Duration:** Choose a specific Start and end date for your automated message using the calendar picker.
- **Indefinite Send:** Check the Send until I turn it off box if you prefer to manually disable the responder later rather than setting an end date.
- **Craft Your Message:** Enter a clear Subject line and detailed Message body to inform contacts of your absence and provide alternative contact info if necessary.
- **Activation:** Toggle the Enabled checkbox to ensure your responder goes live once you click Add.
