#  ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED

The ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED error means your browser couldn't find the IP address for a website's domain name, 
usually due to a DNS issue, an incorrect URL, or a temporary network problem.

Ensure your nameservers (NS) and DNS records are correctly pointing to the intended IP address.
