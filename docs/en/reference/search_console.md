# Google Search Console
[Google Search Console (GSC)](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) is a free tool from Google that helps you monitor, maintain, and troubleshoot your site's presence in Google Search results. Unlike robots.txt or meta tags which provide instructions, GSC provides feedback, showing you exactly how Google sees your pages and where it encounters errors.

### Purpose
To track search performance and technical health. It allows you to see which queries bring users to your site, submit sitemaps for faster crawling, and identify specific mobile usability or indexing issues that could be hurting your rankings.
