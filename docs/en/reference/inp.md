# INP

Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a Core Web Vital that measures a page's overall responsiveness. As of March 2024, Google officially replaced FID (First Input Delay) with INP to provide a more comprehensive look at the user experience.

While FID only measured the delay of the first interaction, INP measures the full time it takes for the page to visually respond to all user clicks, taps, and keyboard inputs.

To provide a smooth experience, aim for an INP of **200ms or less**. Anything between 200ms and 500ms needs improvement, and anything above 500ms is considered poor.
