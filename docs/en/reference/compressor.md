# Image Compressing

Optimizing your images is a important step in modern web development. Using heavy, uncompressed images leads to slow load times and a poor user experience. 
While WordPress offers plugins like **EWWW Image Optimizer**, **Smush**, **ShortPixel**, and **Imagify**, we prefer to optimize images **before** they even reach the database. 
Tools like **[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)** and **[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)** reduce file sizes while maintaining visual quality.

Changing image formats is the next step to achieve additional file size reductions and improve overall site performance. Learn more in the pagespeed section under `Formatting Images`.
