# Image Compressing

Optimizing your images is a important step in modern web development. Using heavy, uncompressed images leads to slow load times and a poor user experience. 
While WordPress offers plugins like **EWWW Image Optimizer**, **Smush**, **ShortPixel**, and **Imagify**, we prefer to optimize images **before** they even reach the database. 
Tools like **[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)** and **[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)** reduce file sizes while maintaining visual quality.
