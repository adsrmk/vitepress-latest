# Schema Markup

Schema markup is a standardized vocabulary of microdata that you add to your HTML to help search engines understand the meaning of your content. 
It tells Google not just that a page has a block of text, but that the text is a recipe, the number `5` is the star rating, and the name **“Jane Doe”** is the author.

This context allows search engines to display your content as a **Rich Snippet** in search results, leading to higher click-through rates.

While some SEO plugins can add basic schema, the most valuable and specific schema often requires custom implementation. You need to programmatically add the correct **JSON-LD** data based on the content of the page.

We found that **Chris Haines**, content writer at Ahrefs, has published a [comprehensive guide](https://ahrefs.com/blog/schema-markup/]) on how to implement and use schema markup.
