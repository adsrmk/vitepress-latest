# CAPTCHA

CAPTCHA is a security tool used on websites to tell the difference between humans and automated bots. Its goal is to block spam and malicious bots from using your forms while letting real people through easily.

It challenges users with tasks that are easy for humans but hard for bots, such as recognizing distorted text or selecting certain images. Bots typically cannot process these tasks effectively.


## Risks Without CAPTCHA

Without CAPTCHA, bots can attack your website by:

- Flooding your contact forms with spam.
- Posting malicious links in your comment sections.
- Creating thousands of fake user accounts.
- Trying to guess passwords on your login page.

These attacks can slow down your site, fill your database with junk, and create security risks.

## Types of CAPTCHA

- **Text-based CAPTCHA**: Users type distorted letters/numbers.  
- **Image-based CAPTCHA**: Users identify objects in images.  
- **reCAPTCHA**: Google's system, often invisible, that analyzes behavior.  
- **Audio CAPTCHA**: For visually impaired users.  


## Best Practices

- Use accessible CAPTCHA options for all users.  
- Place CAPTCHA only where needed (e.g., forms, login pages).  
- Avoid making it too difficult; it should block bots without annoying humans.
