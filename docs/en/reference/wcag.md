# The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the global standard for web accessibility. Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in collaboration with individuals and organizations around the world, they provide a shared set of technical standards for making web content more accessible to people with a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.

While WCAG itself is not a law, it is the benchmark for accessibility, and following these guidelines is the best way to comply with accessibility legislation like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

## The Four Principles of Accessibility (POUR)

WCAG is organized around four fundamental principles, known by the acronym POUR. For content to be accessible, it must be:

* **Perceivable:** Users must be able to perceive the information being presented. This means it can't be invisible to all of their senses. For example, images need text alternatives for screen readers, and audio content needs captions for those who are hard of hearing.
* **Operable:** Users must be able to operate the interface. The interface cannot require an interaction that a user cannot perform. This includes making all functionality available from a keyboard for users who cannot use a mouse.
* **Understandable:** Users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface. The content and its presentation should be clear, predictable, and avoid unnecessary complexity.
* **Robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including current and future assistive technologies. As technologies evolve, the content should remain accessible.

## Conformance Levels: A, AA, AAA

WCAG outlines specific, testable success criteria, which are categorized into three levels of conformance. Each level builds upon the one before it.

* **Level A (Minimum):** This is the most basic level of accessibility. It addresses the most severe barriers for users with disabilities and is considered essential for any website. Conforming only to Level A will still leave significant barriers for many users.
* **Level AA (Mid-range):** This level addresses more barriers and provides a stronger level of accessibility. Level AA is the most common target for organizations and is the level often cited in legal standards. It provides good accessibility for most users on most devices.
* **Level AAA (Highest):** This is the highest and most stringent level of conformance. While it provides the best experience for the widest range of users, it is not always possible to satisfy all Level AAA criteria for all types of content. Therefore, it's not recommended as a general policy requirement but is excellent to strive for where possible.

For our purposes, all development should aim to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.

How does this look as a starting point for the WCAG section?
