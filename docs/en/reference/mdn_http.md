# HTTP Security Headers

The Mozilla Observatory (specifically the HTTP Observatory) is a free security tool developed by Mozilla that helps website owners and developers assess their site's security configuration. 
Originally launched in 2016 and recently migrated to the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) in July 2024, it focuses on analyzing HTTP response headers and modern security standards.
