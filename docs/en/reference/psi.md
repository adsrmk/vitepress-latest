# PageSpeed Insights

PSI is a free tool provided by Google that analyzes the performance of web pages on both mobile and desktop devices. 
It is an essential resource for web developers, SEO specialists, and site owners looking to improve user experience and search rankings.

The Performance Score is a weighted average of several metrics calculated by Lighthouse. It provides a snapshot of your page's technical performance on a scale of 0 to 100:

- 90–100 (**Good**): The page is well-optimized and meets modern standards.
- 50–89 (**Needs** Improvement): There are noticeable bottlenecks.
- 0–49 (**Poor**): Significant issues are likely driving users away.

This score is primarily driven by [Core Web Vitals](#), which are the specific metrics Google uses to measure real-world user experience.
